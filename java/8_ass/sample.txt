India are set to lock horns with Australia in the third ODI of the five-match series at the JSCA
International Stadium Complex in Ranchi as the Virat Kohli-led Men in Blue look to take an
unassailable lead by defeating the Aussies on Friday. Indian skipper Kohli is on the verge of
achieving another milestone in his career. The swashbuckling batsman is just 27 runs away
from joining the likes of MS Dhoni, Mohammad Azharuddin and Sourav Ganguly in an elite
list. If Kohli manages to score 27 runs then the 30-year-old will become only the 12th cricketer
to score past the 4000-run mark as a captain in ODI cricket and will only be the fourth Indian
skipper to do so.
In ODIs, Kohli has 3973 runs while captaining the side, whereas Dhoni had scored 6641 runs
as the Indian skipper in the shorter format of the game. Azharuddin and Ganguly had 5239 and
5104 runs respectively to their name as an Indian ODI skipper.
