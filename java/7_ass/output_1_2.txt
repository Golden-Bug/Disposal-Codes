 The swashbuckling batsman is just 27 runs away
from joining the likes of MS Dhoni, Mohammad Azharuddin and Sourav Ganguly in an elite
list
 If Kohli manages to score 27 runs then the 30-year-old will become only the 12th cricketer
to score past the 4000-run mark as a captain in ODI cricket and will only be the fourth Indian
skipper to do so

In ODIs, Kohli has 3973 runs while captaining the side, whereas Dhoni had scored 6641 runs
as the Indian skipper in the shorter format of the game
 Azharuddin and Ganguly had 5239 and
5104 runs respectively to their name as an Indian ODI skipper
